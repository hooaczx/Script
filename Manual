What you are seeing is me running checks to see whether the game has a detection system. Right now, 
there’s only one game I’m constantly monitoring to make sure it’s safe.
My script is designed for people who use it so that their accounts remain safe. 
If you’re unsure, you might want to create a test account of your own and try running my script there first to see if everything works properly and whether it results in a ban. 
If my script shows this symbol, 
it means I’ve modified it so it cannot be used in that specific game — for example, Dandy’s World. As shown in the picture, 
I may not always be able to check constantly or update things all the time, since I’m just a normal person who also needs to sleep and eat. 
So I might not always have the free time to test everything thoroughly. But I’ll do my best to update the safety system whenever I can to help avoid bans on your accounts
