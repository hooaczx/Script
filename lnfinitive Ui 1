⚠️ Warning from 1hooaczx1:
Hey, just a heads up — this script uses a webhook that grabs some info  
like your account and username to see who ran it.  
It also gets the IP address of the network you’re on.  
Don’t stress though, it’s just the IP of the Wi-Fi or hotspot you’re using,  
not your personal IP or anything like that.
I don’t even know who you really are.  
The only purpose is to check who actually executed my script,  
and the “name” I see is only your roblox account username,
Totally your choice if you wanna use it.  
If you’re cool with it, just copy and run it in your executor.  
If not, no worries — just don’t use it.  
All up to you.
