⚠️ Warning from 1hooaczx1:
This script uses a webhook that may collect your information.
Mainly to check who executed it — your account and username.
Even though some information is collected, it's only the IP address assigned by the network you are using.  
If you connect through someone else's Wi-Fi or hotspot, it will just be the IP address of that Wi-Fi network,  
not your actual personal IP address.  
So don't worry.
It’s up to you whether you want to use it or not.  
If you want to use it, just copy and run it in your executor.
If you don't want to use it, then simply don't copy and paste it into your executor,  
because I'm not asking you to use it — it's completely up to you.
